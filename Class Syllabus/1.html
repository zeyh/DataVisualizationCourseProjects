        <b>Notes</b>
        <p>The theme of our website is "microscopic", so we chose a background image of neurons and make all subsections be in the round shape to illustrate the theme. We create a hovering effect to amplify the small size subsections to let users interact with the content more and feel like they are viewing the page through a microscope. We also made a drop-down menu on top of the web page for navigation. 
        For future improvements, we could make the menu bar more user-friendly and close to the theme. Also, we could add more css animations when scrolling down.    
        </p>
        <b>Questions:</b>
        <p>1. how to make the texts in p also follow a round shape?</p>
        <p>2. how to create the effect that when viewing the current content, some of the css animations are automatically invoked?</p>
        <p>3. how to create a more liquid layout?</p>
        <p>4. how to use the space between subsections more efficiently?</p>
