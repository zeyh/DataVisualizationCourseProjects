<section-title>Catalog Description</section-title>

<p>Data visualization is the act of taking an overwhelming and confusing amount of data and presenting it in a fashion that is coherent, pleasing, and informative. With the advent of computing, the richness data visualization has grown from static pie charts to interactive pie charts that can recalculate themselves as you delve deeper into the data. This revolution has spread to all facets of data visualization. In this class students will create interactive data visualizations utilizing modern web languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and d3 to describe intricate data sets. <prereq>Prerequisite: CSC 117.</prereq>

<section-title>Attendance</section-title>
<p>
I expect that students will be present at all of the classes barring unforeseen circumstances.  Attendance encompasses both showing up on time, staying until the end of the session, and having your materials on you.  
</p>
    </subsection>
<subsection id="on-time">
    <section-title>
We show up on Time:
    </section-title>
    
I expect students to be in class, on time. As this is the only class you are taking this semester, you have complete control over showing up to class on time.  The classroom is also empty before our class, so showing up early is also encouraged.

I will take attendance at the beginning of class.  Being 1 minute late will mark you as absent if I have already closed the attendance sheet.
</subsection>

<subsection id="stay">
    <section-title>
We don't leave early:
    </section-title>
Many of the assignments are in pairs or groups, leaving early is unfair to your partner.  Furthermore leaving early deprives you of the only population on campus (your classmates) that can help you get through problems.

If you do manage to finish your HW before the end of the class:
Start on the reading and prep for the next day
Put in some work on your projects (There is always one assigned)
Help your classmates get their work done

If there is an emergency let me know as you leave.

I'll take attendance at the end of the class session.  
</subsection>

<subsection id="prepared">
    <section-title>We come prepared</section-title>

We need a lot of materials for this class.  Be sure to have them so you do not need to leave class to pick up materials.
</subsection>
<subsection id="Ramifications">
<section-title>Ramifications</section-title>
<p>
Because of the tight scheduling it is not feasible to skip classes and expect it not to affect your grade.  After 3 marked absences (note that we mark attendance twice each day) your grade will drop one letter step (i.e. from B to B-) for each additional absence.
</p>
<p>
If you have an extended illness or situation please let me know so we can plan how to keep you caught up with the class and bypass this.  You are still responsible for finishing your work, but there will be some leeway.
</p>
</subsection>


    
<subsection id="pair">
    <section-title>Pair up</section-title>
<p>With the exception of the last projects, all of your work should be done in pairs assigned by the instructor.  (There might be times when one person must work alone due to the laws of number theory). For the work done in pairs, I'll assume that both of you are putting the work in.  It is really important that both students learn the techniques needed as the final project (which makes up 40% of the grade will be done alone).  If you find that you are having problems with a partner on prep of Homework, simply do your own and let your partner do their own work.  On a project come and talk with me.
</p>

<section-title>Grading Scale</section-title>
    
We will use a Standard Grading scale for this class.  An A starts at 93%, A- starts at 90%.
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection id="average">
<section-title>
    75 is average
    </section-title>
<p>
If you do everything I ask, you should make a C in the course.  Of course, it is possible to do better, and I hope that you do.  Getting higher than 80% on the daily work or 70% on the projects requires that you do something extra.  This can be applying new techniques, delivering themed content, or something even more surprising.  You will have to challenge yourself in order to get above these boundaries.  Keep in mind, appearance matters.
</p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection id="on-time">
<section-title>
Submitting Work on Time
    </section-title>
    <p>
I expect that any work students submit to be complete and on time.  Students will submit all software to Moodle.  You will have to upload all of your work on Turing.  If you plan to be away from campus, install the VPN software when you are off campus (https://secure.centre.edu), or better yet, finish your work before you leave.
    </p>
    <p>
While I do have a personal pet peeve against incomplete work, given the nature of the class (we meet everyday) there is no realistic way to accept late work.  So, For this class, turn in your work as complete as you can.  You have the opportunity to turn in Notes for each assignment in order to mitigate some problems, but there will still be a penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any late work will be assessed at the end of the semester and only if there are good grounds for the late work (horrible illness, death in the family).
    </p>
</subsection>
    
    <subsection id="prep">
<section-title>
Prep Work (10% of grade)
</section-title>
    
<p>You are encouraged to "work" together.
There is a lot of material to read for this class, which will be your primary activity outside of class.  The reading is important. 
While I don't expect that reading will instantly make you an expert in the field, independent reading will help you understand the context of the lecture and come to class with your own questions.
I don't expect you to memorize everything.  In fact there are no tests in this class.  I expect that you will look up the exact syntax when you need it.  But, you need to know what exists so that you know to look it up when you need it.
You are learning.  As you reach out to do more and more amazing things, you'll eventually learn to pick up new things by studying on your own. This is your first step in the process.
    </p>
    <p>To help you engage with the reading I'll expect your to prepare a text document each night before class (first day is exempt as we will do this together in class).  While it is a text document, neatness counts!  Carefully order, arrange, and proof read your notes before you submit them.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Provide an (approximately) 100 word summary of what the reading is about.  Your reading is much bigger than 100 words, you must figure out the most relevant, important facts and discuss them.</li>
    <li>Provide a list of questions that you have over the material.  You should not list any question that can be answer with a simple google search (you should do the google search).  You should provide at least one question that demonstrates  you have read and engaged with the material.  These can be questions about how examples worked (provide page/line numbers), or questions of what you felt was missing from the reading, or questions about the ramifications of the content in further directions.  It is your job to demonstrate that you have engaged the material.</li>
    <li>A set of notes that highlight the big ideas,algorithms, with relevant explanations.  This should usually be about a page.  Notice that the first day of reading is 175 pages.  Not all of that content is important enough to write down.  But what is written down should be explained well. </li>
</ol>

    <p>Prep work is due at midnight, before class.  You will submit your work on Moodle.  You may discuss material with others before writing your report, but all reports should be the product of individuals.</p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection id="homework">
    <section-title>
    Homework-work in pairs( 15% of grade)
    </section-title>
        

<p>
    I will assign a more complex assignment after most classes and ask you to craft something to indicate that you understood the lesson.  
You will submit a website as well as a page of notes (online) about any material that did not make sense, or what you would like to go through in more depth.  Keep in mind that questions on your notes will increase your scores as well as insure that we will discuss it in class.</p>
    <p>You should do this work in your assigned pairs. Both students should submit individual copies of their work.</p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection id="projects">
<section-title>Projects: (15%, 20%, 40% of your grade) </section-title>
First 2 projects must be done in pairs / The last one is an  individual assignment.
Projects make up a sizable portion of your grade.  Except for the final project, very little in class time will be set aside for it.  The first two projects will be done in pairs, the last two projects will be done individually.

<section-title>General Rules for Giving/Getting Help</section-title>

    <p>
    We highly encourage you to help others; it makes you not only a better person, but also a better computer scientist.  Keep in mind that your goal in helping somebody is not to help them get done quickly.  Your goal is to help the other person understand.  Give away too much, and while they might have a perfect score on their lab, they will not be able to pass the exam.  On the other hand if you really hate someone, just tell them the answer (academic dishonesty rules may apply).  As a simple rule of thumb, your professors like to always answer questions with another question to lead students to a solution while at the same time strengthening the mental processes of how to solve problems.
    </p>
    
    <subsection id="help-others"> 
        <section-title>Helping Others</section-title>
    <p>
        <subtitle>If you are seeking help</subtitle> Another person may read your code if you are trying to find a bug. You must acknowledge their help and indicate that they read your code as part of the documentation. <emph>You may not read another person's code</emph> but it is permissible to talk about the solution of the problem (not the actual code). Anyone with whom you discuss the problem must be listed in your documentation.  
    </p>
    <p>
        <subtitle>If you are giving help</subtitle> It is ok to provide other students with sources and page numbers to help them find solutions, this is perhaps the lowest level of help that you can provide and when it is enough, you should strive to help at this level.  You may read another person's code if you are looking for an error. It is their responsibility to list you as a resource. You may not allow another student to read your code "to get the idea." It is permissible to talk about your solution but be judicious about the hints you give. Again, the other student is responsible for listing your help in the documentation. You should indicate that you gave help to this student as part of the documentation of your own program. This will limit false accusations of plagiarism which we are required to report.  
    </p>
    <p>
        <subtitle>Help with written work</subtitle> It is ok to provide other students with sources and page numbers to help them find solutions.  Recall that much of the written work in this class is done on an individual basis.  At no point should someone have access to your work.
    </p>
    </subsection>
<subsection id=help-sources>
    <section-title>
External sources
        </section-title>
    <p>
I expect you to use external sources in order to complete your homework and projects.  You should use sources to look up vocab,  syntax,  algorithms, and designs.  However, you should not expect nor attempt to find online sources to copy wholesale.  This will be viewed as plagiarism and will be submitted to the Dean for academic dishonesty.
    </p>
    <p>
You should feel confident to make use of any d3 libraries included in the d3 site, but you should not include any other libraries for your work, this especially means bootstrap and jquery.  You need to learn how to work with the core languages and libraries of the class for your projects.
    </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection id="help-accomodations">
<section-title>
        Classroom Accommodations:
</section-title>
Federal and state laws require the College to provide reasonable accommodations to students with documented disabilities who request such accommodations. Whatever accommodations are provided, if any, should be the result of a discussion between the students and the Assistant Dean of Advising, who will then provide a signed notice (a signed, laminated accommodation sheet) for the student to show professors and for the professors to sign. A faculty member will likely not know of a student's disability unless the student discloses the disability, through presenting the signed and dated laminated sheet, and the faculty member should not grant a request that is not supported by the accommodation sheet. Please follow the college requirements and we will be pleased to help in any way we can.
