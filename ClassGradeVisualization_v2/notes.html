    <b>Notes: </b>
    <p>We recommend to zoom in for 90% if the screen is not wide enough. </p>
    <p> for project two, we built the web page to visualize students&#39; grades. On the front page, we created a bar chart to show every students' cumulative grades in the end of the semester. In the bar chart, the bars have different colors and heights to presents how each students&#39; standing in the class. 
     <p> After the user clicked one of the bars, they will get more specific and several different viewpoints.</p>   
       
     <p>They can see the pie chart that has six slices corresponding to six sections of their cumulative grade: the percent they lose overall, the final grade, test 1 grade, test 2 grade, homework average grade, and quiz average grade. </p>

    <p> After clicking the slices, users can see a line chart that displays how those grades change every day. We use the line chart so people can quickly detect student performance changes. By default or if they click on the grey slice or the slice label with "final", users will see a line chart that represents students&#39; daily cumulative scores.</p>

        On the title, we use the hand image to suggest the user to click the bars. The transition animations and the hand shape cursor make our website more intuitive. All of our charts are interactive and connected to each other to better tell a story.
    
         </p>
    
    <b>Questions: </b>
    <p>1. Why our initial transition for the bar chart, which happens right after the user refreshes the page, will stop if the mouse hovers on the bar? Is there any way we could fix that without detecting the hover effect when selecting a specific bar?</p>
    <p>2. How to pass the data from one page to another page?</p>
    <p>3. How could we somehow delay the animation? For example, after clicking the bar, the animation in the pie chart has already been activated. </p>
